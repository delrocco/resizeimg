# utools

A collection of various utility / tool scripts I've used over the years.

### Requirements

Python 3  
Some scripts require specific modules like: PIL, pandas, numpy, etc.  

### Listing

| script          | description |
| :---            | :--- |
| `delfiles.py`   | find/delete dirs of files by extension |
| `resizeimgs.py` | resize dirs of imgs respecting aspect ratio |
| `swapcols.py`   | swap 2 cols of a .csv file |
| `utility.py`    | utility script with helpful general purpose functions |
| `oneoffs/`      | one-off scripts that served a specific purpose, provided for src ideas |   

### Notes

Sometimes I find myself needing a specific shell/Python script and I don't immediately find it online. So I write it. Here I have provided some. Hopefully these help someone else :)  
Feel free to use or copy/paste whatever you want.  
Good luck!
